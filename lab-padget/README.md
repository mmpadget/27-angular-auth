# Lab 27: Angular Routing

## Description
For this lab we connected our frontend angular app to a pre-built backend called slugram, added client side authentication, and provided minimal styling from basic wireframes.

## Backend Installation
1. Clone the [slugram](https://github.com/slugbyte/slugram-backend) repo in a separate directory from this repo.
2. Add an env file.
3. Run `npm i`
4. Install MongoDB

## Application

### Frontend
In Terminal run `npm run build`
Result: app/index.html {0} [built]

In Terminal run `npm run build-watch`
Result: "Project is running at http://localhost:8080/", "webpack: Compiled successfully."

### Backend
In 1st Terminal window run `npm run start-debug`
Result: "slugram:sever server up on 3000"

In 2nd Terminal window run `mongo`
Result: "connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"

## API
* POST: `http://localhost:3000/api/signup`
* GET: `http://localhost:3000/api/login`

## Test Setup
```
karma init karma.conf.js

Which testing framework do you want to use ?
> jasmine

Do you want to use Require.js ?
> no

Do you want to capture any browsers automatically ?
> Chrome

What is the location of your source and test files ?
> test/**/*-test.js

Should any of the files included by the previous patterns be excluded ?
> no

Do you want Karma to watch all the files and run the tests on change ?
> no
```
Adjust the configuration karma.conf.js file to:

```
config.set({
  webpack,
  basePath: '',
  frameworks: ['jasmine'],
  files: [
    'test/**/*-test.js',
  ],
  exclude: [
  ],
  preprocessors: {
    'test/**/*-test.js': ['webpack'],
  },
  reporters: ['mocha'],
  port: 9876,
  colors: true,
  logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,
  autoWatch: true,
  browsers: ['Chrome'],
  singleRun: false,
  concurrency: Infinity,
```

## Running Tests
In [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (Terminal) enter the command:

In Terminal enter `npm run test`
Result: "karma start --single-run", "Connected on socket", "0 tests completed"

In Terminal enter `npm run build-watch`
Result: "Project is running at http://localhost:8080/", "webpack: Compiled successfully."
